## Notation guide

We can write the same linear model using different notations, but preserving the same meaning. In this workshop, we will primarily use scalar and probabilistic notation for clarity. Vector and matrix notation are included here for reference. All notations below assume normally distributed errors.

$$
\varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)
$$

The Multivariate Normal distribution (MVN) is a compact way to represent multiple normally distributed observations together.

-   Scalar notation - Represents a single number

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1*x_i + \varepsilon_i \\ \varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)
$$

-   Vector notation - Represents a vector of numbers

$$
\mathbf{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1*\mathbf{x}+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \\[10pt] \begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ ... \\ y_n \end{bmatrix} = \beta_0 + \beta_1*\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ ... \\ x_n \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon_1 \\ \varepsilon_2 \\ ... \\ \varepsilon_n \end{bmatrix} \\[15pt] \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \sim MVN(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I}\sigma^2)
$$

-   Matrix notation - Represents a matrix

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \\ \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \sim MVN(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I}\sigma^2) 
$$

-   Probabilistic notation - Represents the distribution that we are assuming, a clear way to make our assumptions clear. The expected value, or mean, can be expressed using any of the previous notations. To follow the same structure of the workshop, scalar notation will be exemplified.

    -   In distributional notation, see how we demonstrate that the deterministic mathematical equation influences the expectation/mean. The variance, in here, is the same depicted within this part of our previous model: $\varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$.

$$
y_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2) \\ \mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1*x_i
$$
