# Nonlinear Models for the Plant Sciences Workshop

This repository contains the source code for a short workshop on **nonlinear models**, built using **R Markdown** and **bookdown**.

The material is designed to introduce nonlinear modeling concepts through practical examples in R, with an emphasis on model interpretation, uncertainty, and applications in the plant sciences.

## Contents

The Workshop covers topics such as:
- Linear vs nonlinear models
- Parameter estimation approaches, such as Loss Function, Likelihood-based, and Bayesian
- Phenomenological and Mechanistic models
- Identifiability of parameters in nonlinear models
- Working with weakly identifiable parameters
- Bayesian nonlinear models
- Practical examples using real data

## Structure

- `index.Rmd` – Workshop introduction and overview  
- `01-Linear-Models.Rmd` – Day 1
- `02-Nonlinear-Models.Rmd` – Day 2
- `03-Bayesian-Nonlinear-Models.Rmd` – Day 3
- `Palmero_data` – Nitrogen example dataset
- `nonlin/` – Disease epidemic example dataset 
- `_book/` – Rendered output

## Notes
This repository is under active development and primarily intended for educational purposes. Content, structure, and examples may change as the workshop evolves.
